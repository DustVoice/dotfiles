2020-05-17 12:08:15	dustvoice	Hope this is the right place to ask. I'm currently pretty happy with my latex document but one thing is really annoying me and I can't seem to find a solution on the internet. \texttt, as well as \mintedinline don't seem to do linebreaks correctly. The generated PDF can be found under https://git.dustvoice.de/DustVoice/DustArch/raw/branch/master/latex/Documentation.pdf. On page 26 an example of a
2020-05-17 12:08:15	dustvoice	non occuring but needed linebreak in \mintedinline can be seen, on page 27 an example for \texttt. The source code can be found under https://git.dustvoice.de/DustVoice/DustArch/src/branch/master/latex/Documentation.tex with the page 26 example being on line 739 and the page 27 one on line 757. I would love to resolve this last issue I can't seem to get working. I am compiling using xelatex. Thanks

2020-05-17 12:08:51	dustvoice	EDIT: Sorry its \mintinline not \mintedinline
2020-05-17 12:16:45	hrnz	btw I use arch
2020-05-17 12:19:03	hrnz	anyway, font selection does not change hyphenation, but I wouldn't know how to hyphenate /usr/share/zoneinfo either
2020-05-17 12:19:22	hrnz	I don't know whether \mintinline is breakable but it's probably in the manual
2020-05-17 12:20:39	hrnz	you can propose possible hyphenation points like this: /usr/\-share/\-zone\-info
2020-05-17 12:20:45	hrnz	but seriously, don't break that.
2020-05-17 12:24:52	dustvoice	Yeah thought about that too, but would it be possible somehow, to make latex put 'too long' texttt lines on the next line or smth?

2020-05-17 12:25:24	dustvoice	Cause if I have to handle all those things manually, I feel more like working in Word than LaTeX
2020-05-17 12:27:03	dustvoice	I also tried enabling an option of the 'hyphenat' package, but it just lead to a situation where half of the texttt worked like intended and the other half didn't
2020-05-17 12:27:12	dustvoice	Thanks btw for the fast response
2020-05-17 12:27:40	hrnz	\texttt just sets its argument in the tt font.
2020-05-17 12:28:35	dustvoice	ah I see. Well how would one resolve such an issue in the LaTeX world ':)
2020-05-17 12:28:51	dustvoice	Hyphenation really does seem to be a bad idea
2020-05-17 12:29:11	dustvoice	but I don't know if a linebreak before such a long texttt would make sense either
2020-05-17 12:29:58	dustvoice	In addition to it not being automatic. Or is there a way to make LaTeX break before the texttt automatically if it's "too long"
2020-05-17 12:30:16	dustvoice	I'm lost x_X
2020-05-17 12:33:44	dustvoice	Yeah I understand it now. Wouldn't work either if it wasn'
2020-05-17 12:33:48	dustvoice	t in tt fon
2020-05-17 12:33:53	dustvoice	*font
2020-05-17 12:35:05	dustvoice	But the question still stands as to how one would normally resolve such an issue. Linebreak before the non-hyphenatable word would still be the most reasonable way to do it in my opinion, but I might be completely wrong...

2020-05-17 12:59:50	dustvoice	Alright so I tried using \allowbreak{} to allow a linebreak to occur within /usr/share/zoneinfo (/usr/\allowbreak{}share/\allowbreak{}zoneinfo) and it works ... kind of ... Cause one line below it, it looks ugly af. It breaks the word, but so "late" that it still overfills the line
