2020-08-08 21:21:18	dustvoice	Another weird issue I'm encountering on the Lenovo Yoga Laptop of my mother, I also tried this on is that sometimes the screen just starts to flicker. It's an Intel integrated graphics card. I first thought it was some issue with her Manjaro install and/or my portable Arch install, but as I tried to look at some journals and therefore booted into the archiso, the problem still occured. On my
2020-08-08 21:21:18	dustvoice	portable arch install (just an arch install on a USB) it only occurs, after I enter my password for LUKS. It also happens more often during normal usage, after the display gets woken from sleep. I can reproduce it 70% of the time by forcing the standby with `xset dpms force standby`. The flicker starts slowly and then increases in frequency. In approx. 3s one can't see sh*t. I've also tried with
2020-08-08 21:21:18	dustvoice	`nomodeset` etc. without success. Several reboots resolve the error temporarily. Sorry for opening up 2 issues at the same time, but I gotta admit those 2 problems are slowly but steadily driving me insane. And sorry for the wall of text. I can offer cookies for compensation

2020-08-09 00:14:29	dustvoice	Well I've basically got a dotfiles repo with submodules that I can simply clone into my home and I'm ready to go. For everything else I've got a custom guide, which I'm knowing by heart by now. Automated dotfile deployment never kind of met all my expectations, so I'd rather do things manually

2020-08-09 00:15:58	NetSysFire	personally i hate settings things up manually. i dont trust my hands anymore, there will be typos. it will save me some time, especially because typos are frustrating and hard to debug

2020-08-09 00:17:33	dustvoice	well, new install, git init, set remote with upstream and pull. And I'm off to a great start
2020-08-09 00:17:50	dustvoice	well not entirely... git submodule update --recursive --init helps too

2020-08-09 00:21:47	zuntik	ah nothing wrong with the pi
2020-08-09 00:21:58	Scimmia	of course not
2020-08-09 00:22:14	Scimmia	Arch just doesn't run on it, it's x86_64 only
2020-08-09 00:22:22	zuntik	I just don't understand why the root partition is not listed in fstab
2020-08-09 00:22:27	zuntik	only the boot partition
2020-08-09 00:22:35	zuntik	that's all I want to know
2020-08-09 00:22:48	zuntik	fstab has only one entry
2020-08-09 00:22:52	zuntik	why is this?
2020-08-09 00:23:00	dustvoice	Well you could always make your own entry?
2020-08-09 00:23:06	Scimmia	ask your distro, since they're the ones that set it up

2020-08-09 00:23:16	danielrparks	you're probably using the root= command-line argument to tell the kernel where the root filesystem is, so you don't need it in fstab?

2020-08-09 00:23:43	dustvoice	It's not that we don't wonna help, it's just that with custom distros, in this case archlinux-arm do custom stuff
2020-08-09 00:24:11	dustvoice	So we don't know what special quirks archlinux-arm might have cause we run x86_64

2020-08-09 00:25:04	zuntik	yes yes. I understand. I asked here because I expected the question to be general. I think the reply I got here is satisfactory: the bootloader booted it
2020-08-09 00:25:14	zuntik	I just want to make sure that if I add my own entry there
